# Satellite Pose Estimation with Deep Landmark Regression and Nonlinear Pose Refinement (Accepted to ICCVW 2019)

This repo stores the codes used in the paper [Satellite Pose Estimation with Deep Landmark Regression and Nonlinear Pose Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11542). Our approach won the 1st place in the [Kelvin's Pose Estimation Challenge](https://kelvins.esa.int/satellite-pose-estimation-challenge/home/).

Tha relevant dataset can be downloaded from [https://kelvins.esa.int/satellite-pose-estimation-challenge/data/](https://kelvins.esa.int/satellite-pose-estimation-challenge/data/) and should be put in the 'images' folder.
