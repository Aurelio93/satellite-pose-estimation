Our approach won the 1st place in the [Kelvin's Pose Estimation Challenge](https://kelvins.esa.int/satellite-pose-estimation-challenge/home/).

Tha relevant dataset can be downloaded from [https://kelvins.esa.int/satellite-pose-estimation-challenge/data/](https://kelvins.esa.int/satellite-pose-estimation-challenge/data/).
